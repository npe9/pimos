1.  What is PIMOS.

The PIMOS (Parallel Inference Machine Operating System) is
the common operating system of the parallel inference systems, 
all the models of PIM and Multi-PSI.  It provides an efficient and 
comfortable software development environment.

The operating system PIMOS has the following characteristics.

	1) It is written completely in a concurrent logic language
	   KL1, realizing high portability.

	2) Its distributed hierarchical management scheme dissolves
	   bottlenecks in the management job.

	3) Software development tools for the programming in KL1, such
	   as debugging tools and load distribution visualization
	   tools are provided.

	4) It has been practically used as the parallel software R&D
	   environment for more than four years.

	All the application software on PIM or Multi-PSI has been
	developed and running on PIMOS.

2.  The environment of execution

This operating system, PIMOS, is running on the following
systems.

	  All the models of PIM systems
	  Multi-PSI systems
	  PSI-UX systems
	  PSI-II systems

	In the above list, PSI-UX and PSI-II systems are sequential
	processing systems and PIMOS runs in a pseudo-parallel manner.
	These sequential systems are commercially available in Japan
	from Mitsubishi Electric.  The pseudo-parallel system for PSI-UX
         is distributed as a part of the ICOT Free Software.
